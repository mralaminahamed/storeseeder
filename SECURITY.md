## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in StoreSeeder, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

- **Email**: alamin.ahamed.dev@gmail.com
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] StoreSeeder - Brief Description

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much information as possible:

1. **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, privilege escalation, etc.)
2. **Location** of the affected source code (file path and line number if possible)
3. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of concept** or exploit code (if applicable)
5. **Impact** assessment of the vulnerability
6. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
7. **WordPress version, and the e-commerce platform and version** where the issue was discovered
8. **Plugin version** affected

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)
- **Release**: Coordinated with reporter

### Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private reporting** - Issues are reported privately first
2. **Assessment and fix** - We assess and develop fixes internally
3. **Coordinated disclosure** - We coordinate the public disclosure with the reporter
4. **Public disclosure** - After fixes are released and users have time to update

## Security Measures

This plugin implements comprehensive security measures across all components:

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- All user inputs are sanitized using appropriate WordPress functions
- AJAX request data validation and type checking
- Strict data validation for generation parameters
- Proper escaping of all output data

### Access Control & Authentication

- Capability checks for all administrative functions, through `StoreSeeder\Access` — one gate for
  the admin screen, the REST routes, the MCP abilities and the AJAX handlers, so access cannot be
  granted to one and withheld from another. Default `manage_options`; `storeseeder_capability`
  changes it, and a value the filter returns that `current_user_can()` could not use falls back to
  the default rather than through
- Nonce verification for all AJAX requests and form submissions
- Proper user permission validation before data generation
- WordPress authentication integration

### Data Generation Security

- Controlled data generation limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Secure random data generation using WordPress and Faker libraries
- Proper database transaction handling
- Memory usage monitoring during bulk operations

### Admin Interface Security

- React component props validation and sanitization
- Secure AJAX endpoint communication
- CSRF protection for all admin actions
- XSS prevention in admin interface

### Database Security

- Exclusive use of WordPress database API (`wpdb`)
- Prepared statements for all database queries
- No direct SQL query execution
- Proper data sanitization before database insertion

### Asset Security

- Webpack-compiled assets with integrity verification
- Minified production assets to prevent tampering
- Secure asset loading with proper dependency management
- WordPress asset enqueuing standards compliance

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Security Standards

#### Input Handling

```php
// Good - Proper sanitization
$type = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['type'] ?? '' );
$count = absint( $_POST['count'] ?? 0 );

// Good - Validation
if ( empty( $type ) || $count <= 0 ) {
    wp_send_json_error( __( 'Invalid parameters.', 'storeseeder' ) );
}
```

#### Output Escaping

```php
// Good - Escaped output
echo esc_html( $product_name );
echo esc_attr( $form_value );
echo esc_url( $redirect_url );

// Good - Sanitized HTML
echo wp_kses_post( $description );
```

#### Capability Checks

```php
// Good - Permission verification through the single gate, not a literal capability
if ( ! StoreSeeder\Access::current_user_can() ) {
    wp_die( __( 'Insufficient permissions.', 'storeseeder' ) );
}
```

#### Nonce Verification

```php
// Good - CSRF protection
check_ajax_referer( 'storeseeder_nonce', 'nonce' );
```

### React Component Security

```javascript
// Good - Props validation
const DataGenerator = ({ type, onGenerate }) => {
  // Validate props
  if (!type || typeof onGenerate !== "function") {
    return null;
  }

  // Secure API calls
  const handleGenerate = (count) => {
    if (!count || count < 1 || count > 100) {
      return;
    }
    onGenerate(type, count);
  };
};
```

### Database Operations

```php
// Good - Prepared statements
$wpdb->prepare(
    "INSERT INTO {$wpdb->posts} (post_title, post_content) VALUES (%s, %s)",
    $title,
    $content
);

// Good - WordPress API usage
wp_insert_post( wp_slash( $post_data ) );
```

## Vulnerability Scope

We consider the following as security vulnerabilities:

### High Priority

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Stored or reflected XSS vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection** - Any form of SQL injection attack
- **Authentication Bypass** - Circumventing WordPress authentication
- **Privilege Escalation** - Gaining unauthorized admin access
- **Remote Code Execution** - Arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities

### Medium Priority

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - Unprotected state-changing operations
- **Information Disclosure** - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Local File Inclusion** - Unauthorized file access or directory traversal
- **Unsafe File Operations** - Insecure file handling or uploads

### Plugin-Specific Concerns

- **Data Generation Abuse** - Exploiting generation endpoints for DoS
- **Admin Interface Bypass** - Accessing admin functions without proper auth
- **AJAX Endpoint Abuse** - Unauthorized access to plugin AJAX endpoints
- **React Component Vulnerabilities** - XSS or state manipulation in frontend

## Out of Scope

The following are generally NOT considered security vulnerabilities:

- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to respective maintainers)
- WordPress core vulnerabilities (report to WordPress security team)
- Vulnerabilities in the e-commerce platform being written to, such as Fluent Cart (report to that
  platform's team)
- Vulnerabilities in a third-party platform driver registered through `storeseeder_platforms`
  (report to whoever ships the driver)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access attacks
- Denial of Service attacks requiring excessive resources
- Issues requiring admin access to exploit (unless privilege escalation)
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without practical impact
- Self-XSS (requiring user to exploit themselves)

## Security Update Process

When security vulnerabilities are confirmed:

### Severity Classification

1. **Critical**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass
2. **High**: XSS, SQL injection, privilege escalation
3. **Medium**: CSRF, information disclosure
4. **Low**: Minor security improvements

### Response Timeline

1. **Critical vulnerabilities**: Emergency patch within 24-48 hours
2. **High severity**: Patch within 7 days
3. **Medium severity**: Patch within 30 days
4. **Low severity**: Patch in next regular release

### Release Process

1. **Develop fix** in private repository
2. **Internal testing** and validation
3. **Coordinated disclosure** with security researcher
4. **Public release** with security advisory
5. **User notification** through appropriate channels

## Development Security Guidelines

### Code Review Requirements

- All code changes must pass security review
- AJAX endpoints require additional scrutiny
- Database operations must use WordPress APIs
- User input handling requires validation review

### Testing Requirements

- Security-focused unit tests for critical functions
- Integration tests for AJAX endpoints
- Frontend security testing for React components
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Deployment Security

- Secure build process with integrity verification
- Asset minification and obfuscation
- Version control of security-critical files
- Automated security scanning before release
