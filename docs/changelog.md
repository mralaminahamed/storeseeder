Initial release.

### Added

- **17 generators**, each with a REST controller and an optional MCP tool, all persisting through native Fluent Cart models: Products, Product Variations, Customers, Orders, Transactions, Refunds, Coupons, Shipping Plans, Shipping Classes, Tax Classes, Order Tax Lines, Attributes, Cart Sessions, Labels, Product Downloads, Subscriptions, and Logs.
- Modern single-page React admin (React Router v7, Tailwind CSS v4) with a live preview, command palette, and batch queue.
- REST API — every generator at `fluent-cart-fakerpress/v1/<resource>/generate`.
- Optional Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration via the WordPress Abilities API + `mcp-adapter`.
- Filters and actions across the generation lifecycle.
